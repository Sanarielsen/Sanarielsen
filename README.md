### Hi, person! How are you? I hope you fine ðŸ‘‹

Actually I'm working on a project named SAMP for brands and patents for my client.

Currently I'm using the following tech:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Typescript
5. React
6. PHP
7. Java
8. MySql
9. SQLServer
10. C

I'm looking to collaborate as frontend developer, but I don't have a problem to migrate to backend if necessary.

Nowadays, I'm looking for a new challenge to learn about development and acquire experience in the area.

Just call me Samuel, or Sanarielsen, or Sana, or Samu. You choose how these nicknames you call me :)

In my free time, I am working on book to relax. Hopefully soon we will have a news notice about it XD
